        <h3>My first dream is to play in the World Cup, and my second is to become a champion.</h3>

          <p>  These were the now-legendary words of a 12-year-old Diego Armando Maradona, underlining his life ambitions as he spoke on camera for the very first time. He was destined, of course, to live those dreams, becoming an inspirational FIFA World Cup-winning captain for Argentina 13 years after that early interview.</p>

          <p>  This image shows Maradona clutching the prize he had so long coveted, descending amid a sea of fans and well-wishers all eager for a glimpse of Mexico 1986s outstanding player. But had the reality lived up to the dream? The then 25-year-old, having set up the winning goal in a thrilling 3-2 win over West Germany before a crowd of 114,600, left no doubt. "This is the happiest day of my life," he said simply.</p>
 
          <p>  We'd waited all those days at the training camp, thought about it so much, and there I was with my hands on it, he reflected, years later, in an interview with FIFA.com. It makes you so proud. It's the most beautiful thing. Its like touching the sky.</p>
